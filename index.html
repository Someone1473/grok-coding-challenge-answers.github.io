<h1>Grok Coding Challenge Answers</h1>

<p>
  I recommend you try the questions first before you come to this website.
  However I know that isn't going to stop you, and if you really hate coding, you might just copy and paste it.
  However, see these more as a guide to help you get an idea and understand the logic on how to do some of these questions.
  Remember, these are student generated answers, and might not always be the best, but (in theory) always work.
  Have fun coding!
